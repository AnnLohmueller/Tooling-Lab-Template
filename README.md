## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 
9/10, everything should be working with the exception of cypress checking how many tries are done in the game.
## Self-Reflection:
I'm not sure I 100% understand each seperate thing we downloaded, I feel like if they were split up slowly over the modules instead of one heavy optimization lab I would have understood them faster.
